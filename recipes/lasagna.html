    <p><h2>Considered to the hands down, the best lasagna recipe ever. This recipe will walk you
        through how to create the recipe that everyone says, is the best ever!</p></h2>

    <p><h3>Ingredients</p></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
            <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>      
        </ul>

    <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
